#Crystal Game Framework

Crystal is a real-time "twitch" game framework with server and browser side components, written entirely in Javascript. It offers features normally found only in enterprise game engines, such as an authorative server, client side prediction, and position interpolation. Crystal is powered by a great 2D Physics engine which is run both on the server and client, allowing for a "zero-lag" experience. You can read more about Crystal's features in the repo's documentation.

Crystal allows you to focus on your game, not the details of realizing a realtime experience in the face of lag.
